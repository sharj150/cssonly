/* display: flex;
flex-direction: column; (puts elements on top of each other)

display: flex;
flex-direction: row; (puts the elements side by side)

display: flex; (unlocks flex-direction, align-items, justify-content)

display: flex;
align-items: stretch; (stretches the element to the full width of the container)

display: flex;
align-items: center (centres the element vertically)

display: flex:;
align-items: flex-end; (positions elements at the bottom of the container)

justify-content aligns everything horizontally, same position commands as align-items

display: flex;
justify-content: space-around; (space between the elements is the same)

display: flex:
justify-content: space-between; (puts the outermost elements to the sides of the container, with equal space with the middle element)

can use all of these commands for css design, very useful

if flex direction is set to columns, justify-content is now vertical, align-items is now horizontal
